# GenshinFishingBot
Fishing Bot to "Lazy" fish in genshin.  
- Make sure to run as Administrator as simulating mouse events on administrative processes requires admin privileges.  
- Run the genshinimpact.exe with the parameter -popupwindow
- Make sure to run genshin in boderlesswindow mode so that the process doesn't own the GPU output. If you alt tab to a different application and genshin minimizes you're in fullscreen mode. Press alt+enter to enter window mode. 
- Use X, Y, Width and Height to fit the fishing bar (must barely hit the cursor from the bottom)
- **Mihoyo may ban you for this so use at your own risk**
